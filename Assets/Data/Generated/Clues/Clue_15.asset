  clueName: Laurie tells the player (cryptically) that she was bumped into by an
    incoming customer whose clothes were completely dry. When asked if she saw the
    person's face, she simply remarks that these new fangled diner lights are too
    bright for someone like her.
  description: Rude fellow he was, never even apologized for bumping into poor Laurie.
    Seemed to consider himself quite important, fancy new outfit and all.
