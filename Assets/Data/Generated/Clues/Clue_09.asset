  clueName: NPC says that they just went to the club and it was funny that their
    friend thought they had been there right from the start of the dance. But no,
    they only joined at the last hour.
  description: Yaknow, it's a funny place, that. I just dipped in for a pint and
    a pizza and my buddy Jones thought I'd been there the whole time. Man's had too
    many drinks, I'd say.
  additionalDescription: NPC remarks that there's so much going on (loud music, thumping
    bass, strobe lights and drunk people) that everyone is too focused on themselves
    to really notice anyone acting strangely
