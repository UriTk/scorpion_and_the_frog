  clueName: Scorpion remarks that it gets really crowded here in the morning when
    people are going to work
  description: It's always so busy here, at the open and close of every day. Everyone
    goes to work and comes home again, like clockwork. I like to come out here sometimes
    after the evening rush, to get away from all the people - I prefer it when it's
    quieter. Easier to think.
  additionalDescription: The monologue continues with him commenting on different
    times of day. The evening is similar to the morning with people going home, and
    he they like the night more, there are less people then. He likes less people
    because it's more silent
